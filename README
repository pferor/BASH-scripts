NOTES:

`sngmail.sh' vs `ngmail.sh'

  `sngmail.sh' is better to use on a CLI interface to retrive the
  number of new messages. In this script, the password is asked
  interatively. In `ngmail.sh' the password must be entered as a
  option, which is unsecure for the command line since it gets
  recorded on the history, but nice for scripts (with perms. 600).

`qsdown.sh' and `sierra_st'

  `qsdown.sh' downloads on track or range of tracks from
  QuestStudios.com by assembling the URI. `sierra_st' uses `qsdown.sh'
  for downloading complete soundtracks without searching for the
  correct URL.
